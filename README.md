# Extentions_Randoms
This application simply primts random outputs

To run, simply run the .EXE file

This application displays random output in the form of a limited set of integers, a limited set of strings, or a fixed coin toss.
The functionality is limited to one random type; others must be enabled by uncommenting the methods within the code itself.
